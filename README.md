#### The app has following packages:
1. **model**: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
2. **repository**: Repository classes that have access to retrofit and apis.
3. **ui**: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel , dialogs and adapters
4. **helper**: Utility classes.

#### Classes have been designed in such a way that it could be inherited and maximize the code reuse.
